# Merlins-Towers
A variation on Milton Bradleys game Cant Stop. 

#### The premise is simple: Roll the dice and attempt to scale the towers. You choose how to pair the 4 dice you roll to determine which towers you climb. You can only climb a certain amount of towers. Towers on the out edge (2 and 12) have the fewest rungs to climb but are the hardest to get. Towers toward the center are more common in the rolls but have higher peaks to claim.

#### Capture 3 towers before your luck breaks. On your turn, you control how long you press your luck. Will you keep rolling and risk all progress this turn or will you play it safe and let the next player have their turn?

#### You can pass if you dont think you can safely progress, you can pass, but your opponent may take the lead instead.


This game was made way back in college and may or may not work right off the bat, taking some creative license for the original project.
